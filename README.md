# Face Generator GAN

This work is part of Udacitys Deep Learning Nanodegree (Project 4). The GAN (generative adversarial network) consists of a discriminator network (identifying real vs fake faces) and a generator that converts a random noise input vector into realistic images of faces.

The networks are trained on the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), containing around 200k images of famous people.
